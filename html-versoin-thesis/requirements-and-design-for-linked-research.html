<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p id="prologue">
<q cite="https://archive.org/stream/periclesandaspa03landgoog#page/n100/mode/2up">Nothing is pleasanter to me than exploring in a library.</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>]
Many years have past by since this quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Savage_Landor">Walter Savage Landor</a>. Meanwhile technology has evolved and brought the World Wide Web to life: A massive library full of data, where knowledge is often represented in an unstructured, machine-unfriendly manner. <i>more to come...</i>
</p>


<section id="problem-statement">
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<div>
<p>
Through movements like Open Access, data and research publications have become more accessible for the general public. But Sarven Capadisli et. all state in their publication Enabling Accessible Knowledge the following: <q cite="http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#motivation">While there are notable efforts making research publications and data available for free with open access, there is a self-evident disconnect between research documents as far as machines are concerned.</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">2</a>] According to them, research documents are not as human and machine friendly as they could be, making it unpleasant to us - but also for the machines - to explore research documents on the Web.
</p>
<p>
As reported by Frank van Harmelen and Dieter Fensel in their publication Practical Knowledge representation for the Web, the lack of semantic markup is a major barrier to develop more intelligent document processing on the web. [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">3</a>]
</p>
<p>
In order to close the disconnect between research documents, Sarven Capadisli is in progress to develop a tool to share and reuse research knowledge by employing the native Web technology stack. The project called Linked Research will enable researchers to take full control, ownership and responsibility of their own knowledge, making it possible to like-minded people as Walter Savage Landor to explore the giant library called “Web” in a user-friendly way. [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">4</a>]
</p>
</div>
</section>




<section id="goal">
<h3>Goal</h3>
<div>
<p>
As part of a possible solution to make research knowledge more accessible and pleasanter for people and especially machines, Linked Research is going to implement a authoring tool to create and edit research papers directly within a browser. In addition it will enable the user to author triple statements to assign the document with markup.
</p>
<p>
The objective of this thesis is to establish requirements for a user-friendly tool to create scholarly publications and the triple editing feature. The feature facilitates the enrichment of publications with metadata and enables scientists to make research knowledge more accessible to societies and more consumable for machines.

<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
<div>
<p>
This chapter is intended to provide background information and define terms to understand this thesis.
</p>

<section id="html">
<h3>HTML</h3>
<div>
<p>
The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the core language of the World Wide Web (WWW) and currently released as version 5.0. The language is used to create web pages and is recommended by the main international standards organization for the WWW (W3C, World Wide Web Consortium).
HTML specifies the structure of a website with tags (like  <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " >&lt;html&gt;</span> ). The following listing shows the basic structure of an HTML 5 document:
 
<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true " >&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Title of the Web page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)

<section id="dom">
<h3>The DOM (Document Object Model)</h3>
<div>
<p>
The DOM is a language neutral interface, which allows scripts to dynamically access and change the structure of an (HTML)-document. With the DOM it is possible for scripting languages like JavaScript to access HTML elements and rearrange, delete or add new elements to the HTML-document. The DOM makes DHTML (Dynamic HTML) possible. (http://www.w3.org/DOM/)
</p>
</div>

<section id="web-browsers">
<h3>Web Browsers</h3>
<div>
<p>
Web browsers (or just browsers) are used to represent web pages on the World Wide Web. They provide the user interface for web applications. The current major browsers on the market are Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera and Safari with their corresponding web browser engines Blink (Google Chrome and Opera) Trident (Internet Explorer), Gecko (Firefox) and Webkit (Safari). The web browser engine is a software component that is responsible to display content on the screen. 
</p>
</div>
</section>




<section id="linked-data">
<h3>Linked Data</h3>
<div>
<p>
Linked Data is part of the Semantic Web and describes free available structured data reachable through Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). It is published in a format (often RDF) so that it can be interlinked with other data, and through that, be more useful. (Ca-padisli 2013).
</p>
<p>
Time Bernes-Lee published on 2006-07-27 an article called „Linked Data – Design Issues“. In this publication Bernes-Lee addresses four rules for Linked Data:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use URI as names for things.</li>
<li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
<li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF, SPARQL).</li>
<li>Include links to other URIs. So that they can discover more things.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</section>



<section id="http-uri">
<h3>HTTP URI</h3>
<div>
<p>
As seen in Chapter 2.1, URIs help to refer to things and concepts on the web and build the basis of Linked Data. URIs are used to identify a name of a resource on the web. The HTTP scheme is the most common used form of URIs. They provide us a simple way to explore the web and its resources (Berners-Lee 2006).
</p>
</div>
</section>



<section id="rdf">
<h3>RDF</h3>
<div>
<p>
RDF is a family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications. In essence it is an entity-relationship model that lets anyone make any statement about anything. A statement is composed of three atomic parts – the subject, predicate and object. These parts together are called a triple. The subject (line 1 of listing 2) says what the statement is about and the predicate (line 2 of listing 2) describes the relationship to its object (line 3 of listing 2) resource. Typically triples are represented by HTTP URIs. The following triple statement gives an example:
</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >&lt;http://renatostauffer.ch/i#&gt;
&lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows&gt; 
&lt;http://csarven.cs/#i&gt; </pre> 
<p>
This statement says that the thing  <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " >&lt;http://renatostauffer.ch/i#&gt;</span>  knows the thing  <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " >&lt;http://csarven.cs/#i&gt;</span> . Those things (resources) can now be further described with different RDF vocabularies. (RDF Working Group 2014). As the example from above shows, predicates are vocabulary terms that are used to relate the subject with an object. The predicate itself is an HTTP URI, which has a description for the term in use when dereferenced. (Capadisli 2012).

<section id="rdfa">
<h3>RDFa</h3>
<div>
<p>
Resource Description Framework in Attributes or simply RDFa is a W3C recommendation that enables authors of HTML, XHTML and other XML-based document types to enrich their documents with metadata. RDFa provides a set of attributes to describe elements in XML languages:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>about</dt>
<dd>What is the resource about (subject in a triple statement)</dd>
<dt>rel / rev</dt>
<dd>Relationships between resources (predicate in a triple statement)</dd>
<dt>resource</dt>
<dd>Specifies the context (To which URL does the markup apply?)</dd>
<dt>src / href / resource</dt>

<h3>Component Based Software Engineering</h3>
<div>
<p>
A component based software engineering approach according to Sommerville (2007) is applied (see also Chapter XXX). This approach tries to reuse existing software and frameworks as much as possible and thus reduces development time for a much faster delivery. Image XXXX shows the different stages of this reuse-oriented approach. (Sommerville, 2007) <i>More to come...</i>

<h2>Requirement Engineering</h2>
<div>
<p>
In this chapter, the requirements for the authoring tool will be established. For this propose parts of the requirements engineering framework according to Phol et. all is used as a reference. The used framework is structured as follows:
</p>
<figure class="figure">
<a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/framework-pohl.png"><img src="http://renatostauffer.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/framework-pohl-300x296.png" alt="framework-pohl" width="300" height="296" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-621" /></a>

<p>
Firstly the System Context will be described to identify important characteristics of the system and give the reader of this thesis an overview of the system’s context.
Depending on the established context, goals are determined and scenarios to be implemented are worked out. 
</p>

<section id="system-context">
<h3>System Context</h3>
<div>
<p>
Each software-intensive system lies within a certain context and is through that influenced by the definition of the system requirements (Phol et all, 2012). This chapter describes the system context with its facets. The Usage Facet, Subject Facet, IT-System Facet and Development Facet each describe a certain aspect of the system and build the entry point for the systems requirements.
</p>
<p>The system context was established based on interviews with Mr. Sarven Capadisli and studying the following artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A publication about Linked Research (<a href="http://linked-research.270a.info/linked-research.html">http://linked-research.270a.info/linked-research.html</a>)</li>
<li>A publication about Enabling Accessible Knowledge (<a href="http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge">http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge</a>)</li>
<li>Linked Research Github repository (<a href="https://github.com/csarven/linked-research">https://github.com/csarven/linked-research</a></li>
</ul>
<section id="usage-facet">
<h4>Usage Facet</h4>
<div>
<p>
The Usage Facet describes how the user interacts with the system (Phol et all, 2012). In the case of the Linked Research the Usage Facet is described with the UML 2.0:
</p>
<figure class="figure">
<a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Use-Case-Diagram12.png"><img src="http://renatostauffer.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Use-Case-Diagram12-300x197.png" alt="Use Case Diagram1" width="300" height="197" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-657" /></a>
<figcaption>

</figure>
<p>
As we can see on image XXX, the user interacts with the editor on several ways:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Edit Text</dt>
<dd>This is the most basic use case for Linked Research. The user creates or edits text directly in the browser.</dd>
<dt>Create Triple Statement</dt>
<dd>The user can provide triples to the written text via a triple authoring tool. For this to be working, the use cases Assign Subject, Assign Predicate and Assign Object need to be processed.</dd>
<dt>Remove Triple Statement</dt>
<dd>The user can remove added triple statements from the document.</dd>
<dt>Automatic Markup</dt>
<dd>A user usually does not have the time to enrich the whole publication with metadata by hand. Because of that, the use case Automatic Markup should provide the possibility to automatically markup the created text with metadata.</dd>
<dt>Local Storage</dt>
<dd>The text the user is editing gets stored locally. This way, off-line editing is possible.</dd>
<dt>Export Document</dt>
<dd>The user of Linked Research is able to export the document in HTML format or print the document (PDF format).</dd>
<dt>Change View</dt>
<dd>The user of Linked Research can apply different views for the document (LNCS ACM W3C-REC Native)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</section>

<section id="subject-facet">
<h4>Subject Facet</h4>
<div>
<p>
Table XXX describes objects and events within the system context that are important for the system. This facet describes what must be represented by the system (Phol et all, 2012).
</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Object</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td>RDF Subject</td>
<td>An RDF Subject represents some part of the document the author writes. This can either be a single or multiple words, a single or multiple paragraphs or the hole document itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RDF Predicate</td>
<td>A RDF predicate is the second part of a triple statement and defines the property for the RDF Subject. A predicate must always be a Uniform Resource Identifier.</td>
