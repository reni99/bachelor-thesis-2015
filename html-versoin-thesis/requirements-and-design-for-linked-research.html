<dt>Management Summary</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Research documents on the Web are not as human and machine friendly as they could be. They lack of semantic markup and do not use today&#8217;s capabilities offered by the World Wide Web, to make them more enjoyable and interesting for consumers. Linked Research is an open source project for a semantic content authoring tool, which addresses this problem.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this thesis is to establish requirements for Linked Research, propose a user interface for the semantic authoring and compare WYSIWYG editors as well as RDFa parsing libraries to evaluate them respectively.
</p>
<p>
The lack of semantic markup is a major barrier to develop more intelligent document processing on the web. Semantically enriched documents enable more sophisticated ways to flexibly visualize information and create more efficient and effective search interfaces. The question this thesis tries to answer is, what kind of user interface is most suitable for Linked Research&#8217;s triple authoring feature regarding, the established requirements? Additionally the thesis tries to answer the following question: What kind of WYSIWYG editors as well as RDFa parsing libraries are available on the market to implement Linked Research&#8217;s triple authoring feature?
</p>
<p>
The functional and non-functional requirements for Linked Research were established by applying the requirements engineering framework according to Pohl et al. These requirements combined with related work, literature research and meetings with the project leader of Linked Research, built the basis to propose the user interface. Relevant WYSIWYG editors and RDFa parsing libraries were gathered and compared based on established criteria, to build the basis for a later evaluation.
</p>
<p>
This thesis resulted in having functional and non-functional requirements for Linked Research, proposes a user interface for the triple authoring feature and provides a comparison of WYSIWYG editors as well as RDFa parsing libraries.
</p>
<p>
Looking forward, this thesis offers the project leader of Linked Research a basis to evaluate a suitable WYSIWYG editor and RDFa library. The established requirements will be integrated into the project&#8217;s repository / documentation to facilitate it for other developers to join the open source project.

<p id="prologue">
PDF documents are familiar and easy to read for humans. But they are also <q cite="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663789/">antithetical to the spirit of the Web, lacking user interactivity and being difficult for machines to read</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>] according to &#8220;Adventures in Semantic Publishing: Exemplar Semantic Enhancements of a Research Article&#8221; by David Shotton et al.
</p>
<p>
While there have been many efforts in making research publications more accessible and machine friendly through semantic publishing, scholarly communication is predominantly held in data silos like PDF documents or in conventional HTML Web pages with little semantical markup [<a class="ref" href="#ref-2">2</a>]. Here is a brief look at some points in history.</p>
<p>
<p>
Tim Berners-Lee, working at CERN in 1989, needed an information system that would help scientists to create and discover each other&#8217;s documents across systems. In the same year he made a proposal for an information management system; todays World Wide Web [<a class="ref" href="#ref-3">3</a>].
</p>
<p>
The Web today contains interlinked hypertext documents as proposed in 1990 by him and Robert Cailliau. Their idea of having one-directional hyperlinks between documents and accessing information as a web of nodes [<a class="ref" href="#ref-4">4</a>] has emerged as a large universe of documents, where ideas can be exchanged and knowledge shared between people or institutions.
</p>
<p>
In 1991 the Camelot Project was launched with the vision to <q cite="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/products/about-adobe-pdf.html">capture documents from any application, send electronic versions of these documents anywhere, and view and print these documents on any machines</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-35">35</a>]. By 1992 The Camelot Project eventually developed into PDF, today&#8217;s de facto standard when it comes to document formats [<a class="ref" href="#ref-36">36</a>].
</p>
<p>
PDF and other machine unfriendly formats even dominate in the Web Science community as the community <q cite="http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#web-science-community">continues to conduct research tracks, workshops, and challenges, in a manner that even the call for papers of top-level Web conferences request research documents that are neither machine nor Web-friendly</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">5</a>]. Submissions are often solely demanded in Word or PDF formats, where it is challenging to extract information from within [<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">5</a>].

<div about="[this:#problem-statement]" property="dcterms:description">
<p>
Through movements like Open Access, data and research publications have become more accessible for the general public. But Sarven Capadisli et al. state in their publication Enabling Accessible Knowledge the following: <q cite="http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#motivation">While there are notable efforts making research publications and data available for free with open access, there is a self-evident disconnect between research documents as far as machines are concerned</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">5</a>]. According to them, research documents are not as human and machine friendly as they could be, making it unpleasant to us &#8211; but also for the machines &#8211; to explore research documents on the Web.
</p>
<p id="barrier-intelligent-document-processing">
As reported by Frank van Harmelen and Dieter Fensel in their publication &#8220;Practical Knowledge representation for the Web&#8221;, the lack of semantic markup is a major barrier to develop more intelligent document processing on the web [<a class="ref" href="#ref-7">7</a>].
</p>
<p>
The open source project called Linked Research, developed by Sarven Capadisli, will enable researchers to take full control, ownership and responsibility of their own knowledge, making it possible to get away from machine unfriendly formats by exploiting the Webs current possibilities to explore hypertext documents in a user-friendly way [<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">5</a>].
</p>
<p>
Linked Research has not established concrete requirements yet, so that developers can easily contribute to the project. Additionally an editor component and RDFa parsing library need to be evaluated to push the project further.</p>

<p>
Linked Research is a semantic content authoring tool (SCA), which makes research knowledge more accessible and more pleasant to read for people and machines. It enables authors to edit research papers directly from a Web browser and to enrich the document with semantic annotations. Consumers of these papers benefit from more interactive and enjoyable publications while machines can extract more information about those.
</p>
<p>
The objective of this thesis is to establish requirements for Linked Research, compare editing libraries and provide an overview of RDFa Tools available on the market.

The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the core language of the World Wide Web and currently released as version 5.0. The language is used to create web pages and is recommended by the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) [<a class="ref" href="#ref-8">8</a>].
HTML specifies the structure of a website with tags (like  <code>html</code> ). The following listing shows the basic structure of an HTML 5 document:

Linked Data is part of the Semantic Web and describes free available structured data reachable through Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). It is published in a format (often RDF) so that it can be interlinked with other data, and through that, be more useful [<a class="ref" href="#ref-13">13</a>].
</p>
<p>
Time Berners-Lee published on 2006-07-27 an article called „Linked Data – Design Issues“. In this publication Berners-Lee addresses four rules for Linked Data [<a class="ref" href="#ref-13">13</a>]:
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData">
<ol>
<li>Use URI as names for things.</li>
<li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
<li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF, SPARQL).</li>
<li>Include links to other URIs. So that they can discover more things.</li>

URIs build the basis of Linked Data and are used as names for things [<a class="ref" href="#ref-13">13</a>]. They are a sequence of characters to identify an abstract or physical resource on the Web [<a class="ref" href="#ref-14">14</a>]. The HTTP scheme is the most common used form of URIs and is used since 1990 by the World-Wide Web global information initiative [<a class="ref" href="#ref-15">15</a>].

RDF is a resource description framework to express information about resources. The framework is specified by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and lets anyone make any statement about anything [<a class="ref" href="#ref-16">16</a>]. A statement is composed of three atomic parts (subject, predicate and object). Those three parts together are called a triple. The subject (line 1 of listing 2) says what the statement is about and the predicate (line 2 of listing 2) describes the relationship to its object (line 3 of listing 2) resource. Typically, triples are described by HTTP URIs [<a class="ref" href="#ref-17">17</a>]. The following triple statement gives an example:
</p>

<code>&lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;http://csarven.cs/#i&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>
The statement from above says that the thing <code>&lt;http://renatostauffer.ch/i#&gt;</code>  knows the thing  <code>&lt;http://csarven.cs/#i&gt;</code> . Those resources (things) can now be further described through RDF vocabularies, which provide semantic information about these resources [<a class="ref" href="#ref-18">18</a>]. As the example from above shows, predicates are vocabulary terms that are used to relate the subject with an object. The predicate itself is an HTTP URI, which has a description for the term in use when dereferenced.

Resource Description Framework in Attributes or simply RDFa is a W3C recommendation that enables authors of HTML, XHTML and other XML-based document types to enrich their documents with metadata. RDFa provides a set of attributes to describe elements in XML languages [<a class="ref" href="#ref-19">19</a>]:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/#A-about">about</a></dt>
<dd>Defines what the resource is about (subject in a triple statement) [<a class="ref" href="#ref-20">20</a>].</dd>

<dd>Those three attributes are used to state the object of a triple statement. While the <samp>resource</samp>-attribute is intended to state a non-navigable partner resource of a subject [<a class="ref" href="#ref-22">22</a>], the <samp>href</samp>-attribute is used in conjunction with navigable resources [<a class="ref" href="#ref-23">23</a>]. The <samp>src</samp>-attribute is used, when a resource is embedded [<a class="ref" href="#ref-24">24</a>].</dd>

The idea of having a publishing tool paired with a triple markup feature is nothing new. Different products, with different focuses have emerged. Three of those products are <a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/requirements-engineering-for-linked-research/#rdface">RDFaCE</a>, <a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/requirements-engineering-for-linked-research/#loomp">Loomp</a> and <a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/requirements-engineering-for-linked-research/#wordlift">Wordlift</a>, which will be introduced in the following sections. RDFaCE has been chosen because the focus of this product lies on usability, which is a major requirement of Linked Research (see section XXX). The other two tool&#8217;s main focus lies on simple solutions concerning the semantic enrichment of documents by non-domain experts. Linked Research focuses also on accessibility, (see section XXX) which make loomp and Wordlift good candidates to showcase related work.

<p>
RDFaCE is a semantic content authoring (SCA) tool, which integrates four different views on the semantically annotated content. Those views are synchronized, which means that when a change in a view happens, the other views apply the change. The focus of RDFaCE lies on usability by implementing the four views for different personas involved in the content creation life-cycle.
</p>
<p>The four views RDFaCE implements are [<a class="ref" href="#ref-27">27</a>]:</p>

The main focus lies on simplicity by providing an intuitive interface. The editor allows users to annotate words or phrases with references to ontologies and to create relationships between annotated phrases. Loomp relies on a server to handle and process the semantic content [<a class="ref" href="#ref-29">29</a>].

Wordlift is a semantic web plugin for the content management system (CMS) WordPress. The user is able to run a semantic web analysis on an authored text to find entities from the Linked Open Data Cloud, that do match words or phrases within the text. After an entity has been found, the user can bind it to the text. It is also possible to manually create entities, which do not exist in the Linked Open Data Cloud yet [<a class="ref" href="#ref-30">30</a>].

In this section, we will derive functional and non-functional requirements for Linked Research. According to Sommerville, functional requirements are services the system should provide. They determine how the system should react to inputs and how it should behave in certain situations [<a class="ref" href="#ref-33">33</a>, p. 119]. On the other hand, non-functional requirements define constraints on the functionality offered by the system. They often apply to the whole system and relate to system properties such as usability, reliability or portability [<a class="ref" href="#ref-33">33</a>, p. 119 -122].
</p>
<p>
In this thesis the requirements engineering framework according to Pohl et al. [<a class="ref" href="#ref-31">31</a>] is used as a reference to establish the requirements. The used framework is structured as shown in figure 3 (Fig. 3).

<p>
The framework is composed of three parts: The System context, Core activities and Requirements artifact.
</p>
<p>
Firstly the System Context with its four facets (subject, usage, IT system and development facet) will be described to identify important characteristics of the system and give the reader of this thesis an overview of the system’s context.
Depending on the established context, goals were determined and scenarios to be implemented are worked out. Those requirement artifacts are documented in the section <a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/requirements-and-design-for-a-tool-to-author-triple-statements/#requirements-goals">5.3 Goals</a> as functional and non-functional requirements and <a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/requirements-and-design-for-a-tool-to-author-triple-statements/#requirements-scenarios">5.4 Scenarios</a>.

The management and validation of the requirements are not addressed in this thesis.

Each software-intensive system lies within a certain context and is through that influenced by the definition of the system requirements [<a class="ref" href="#ref-31">31</a>]. This section describes the system context with its facets for Linked Research. The Usage Facet, Subject Facet, IT-System Facet and Development Facet each describe a certain aspect of Linked Research and build the entry point for the systems requirements.
</p>
<p>The system context was established based on meetings with Sarven Capadisli, studying the already existing tools in section (XXX) and consulting the following artifacts:</p>

Figure 2 (Fig. 2) describes the two stakeholders (author and consumer) and how they interact with Linked Research. If the term <samp>user</samp> or <samp>users</samp> is used in this thesis, both stakeholders (author and user) are addressed. From a user&#8217;s perspective the following use cases arise:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Edit Text</dt>
<dd>This is the most basic use case for Linked Research. The author creates or edits text directly in the browser.</dd>
<dt>Add Triple Statement</dt>
<dd>The author can enrich the written text with RDF triples via a triple authoring tool. For this to be working, the user must be able to define a subject, predicate and object of a triple.</dd>
<dt>Triple Creation Support</dt>
<dd>Linked Research may support authors to add triple statements by providing suggestions for predicates or objects in the triple creation process. This is useful for non-domain experts and used by other SCA tools like RDFaCE.</dd>
<dt>Remove Triple Statement</dt>
<dd>The author can remove added triple statements from the document.</dd>
<dt>View Document Graph</dt>
<dd>A user can view the document and its triple statements as a visualized graph. This enables the author to quickly review triple statements and their relation. Consumers obtain the possibility to explore the document in a visual way and figure out how sections of the document are related to each other or external resources.</dd>
<dt>Rearrange Table of Content</dt>
<dd>A user can rearrange the table of content. This will automatically update the sections of the document.</dd>
<dt>Local Storage</dt>
<dd>The text the author is editing gets stored locally. This way, off-line editing is possible.</dd>
<dt>Export Document</dt>
<dd>The user is able to export the document in HTML format or print the document (PDF format).</dd>
<dt>Change View</dt>
<dd>The user can apply different views for the document without changing the underlaying structure of the DOM. The following views are provided: <samp>LNCS</samp>, <samp>ACM</samp>, <samp>W3C-REC</samp> and <samp>Native</samp>.
</dl>
<p>
The use cases <samp>Change View</samp>, <samp>Local Storage</samp>, <samp>Export Document</samp>, <samp>Rearrange Table of Content</samp> and <samp>Section Identification</samp> have already been implemented into Linked Research by Sarven Carpadisli. The other use cases are open to be implemented. The focus of the following sections lies on the not yet implemented use cases
</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>Add Triple Statement</samp>,</li>
<li><samp>Triple Creation Support</samp>,</li>
<li><samp>Remove Triple Statement</samp>,</li>

<li><samp>Enable Editing Mode</samp>,</li>
<li><samp>Auto Saving</samp>,</li>
<li>and <samp>Edit Text</samp>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Based on the already existing user interface and the not yet implemented use cases of Linked Research, the mockups in figure XXX and XXX were drawn. Mockups build a nice way to illustrate a system in color and shape, without its functionality. They can be used to gather requirements concerning the look of a system [XXX]. Figure XXX shows Linked Research&#8217;s user interface after clicking on the menu button (see figure XXX, 1).

<li>The table of content provides an overview of the document. Authors and consumers can rearrange the sections or click on a section to jump to the corresponding position in the document.</li>
<li>Users can switch between different views for the document.</li>
<li>Users can print the current view.</li>
<li>Turtle or JSON-LD (both languages to express data in the RDF data model) data can be embedded into the document</li>

The TripleEditor object uses the triple store to persist triple statements (Triples) and the SearchHandler object to talk to external services. The Editor object uses the TripleEditor when metadata is inserted. The objects LR, U and C are already implemented in Linked Research. The LR object belongs to the core and contains two object itself (U and C). The U object is responsible the display or hide UI related things like the menu or the table of content as shown in figure XXX. C contains helper functionality / attributes.

Especially the editor and the triple store are parts of Linked Research that do not have to be developed from ground. There are a lot of existing projects, which provide such functionality. Section XXX and XXX show how the two components (editor and RDF triple store) got evaluated for Linked Research.
</p>
<p>
Github (a versioning tool) is used to manage the code base of Linked Research and prototypes.
</p>
<p>The publication <a href="http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge">Enabling Accessible Knowledge</a> defines in the section <a href="http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#conceptual-design">Conceptual Design</a> design principles, to which Linked Research sticks to. Those are:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>The Rule of Least Power</dt>
<dd>This means that when developing for the Web, the least powerful language should be chosen [XXX]. Capadisli et al. state in Enabling Accessible Knowledge the following: <q cite="http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#conceptual-design">By design, HTML fulfils the principle of least power. As far as computer languages and their environments go, HTML is the least common denominator; it can be used virtually from any device; from command-line terminals, desktop browsers, smartwatches to cars, whether on or offline. Together with HTTP, the undeniable penetration of HTML, both on a technological and social level makes it a clear winner for information distribution</q> [http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#conceptual-design].</dd>
<dt>RFC 1958</dt>
<dd>This Request for Comments (RFC) says, that:<q cite="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1958#section-1">the principle of constant change is perhaps the only principle of the Internet that should survive indefinitely</q> [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1958#section-1].</dd>

Based on the system&#8217;s context, goals for Linked Research are determined. It is distinguished between functional and non-functional goals according to I. Sommerville [<a class="ref" href="#ref-33">33</a>]. The terms goal and requirement are used as  synonyms in this thesis.

Possible user interface for the TripleEditor
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The possible interface is composed of two parts. The first part (circle labeled <strong>1</strong> on Fig. 6) offers an author the possibility to create new triple statements and search for predicates or RDF objects from an external service. The second part (circle labeled <strong>2</strong> on Fig. 6) serves as interface to delete existing triples from the document and triple store.

<p>A search for the terms <samp>approaches wysiwyg editors</samp> and <samp>text editing approaches on web</samp>, led to the following Wikipedia page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_rich-text_editor">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_rich-text_editor</a>. This source is not scientific enough for the thesis, but offers new insights on what kind of search terms could be used to get more relevant material. The consultation of the page led to the following new search terms: <samp>contentEditable</samp>, <samp>alternatives for contentEditable</samp>, <samp>designMode</samp>, <samp>textarea</samp>, <samp>inline editing wysiwyg</samp>, <samp>iframe wysiwyg editor</samp>.  
Searches on <a href="https://www.google.ch/?gws_rd=ssl">Google.com</a> for these terms resulted in the following approaches to edit text on the Web:
</>
<dl>
<dt>Inline editing</dt>
<dd>
Inline editing is described as follows by [http://ux.stackexchange.com/tags/inline-edit/info]:
<blockquote>
Inline edit is a design pattern that enables the user to edit text directly in the page without requiring going to a separate page or opening a dialog overlay. It makes the interaction more direct and intuitive as the user can edit the text in the same place where it is shown.
</blockquote>
<p>
The same definition is used in the documentation of the CKEditor, a well known WYSIWYG editor [http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_inline].
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Framed editing</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Framed editing, also called <samp>classic editing</samp>, is described by [http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_framed] as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
In this usage scenario the editor is most often represented by a toolbar and an editing area placed in a specific position on the page, usually as a part of a form that you use to submit some content to the server. Sometimes it is also called &#8220;framed editing&#8221;, because in this case the editor creates a temporary <code>iframe</code> element for itself.
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
From a more technical code level view, these two approaches are enabled through the use of the following techniques:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="text-editing-designmode">designMode</dt>
<dd>The designMode attribute of the <code>document</code> object is able to make a whole HTML-page editable by just setting it to true [source http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#editing-0].
</dd>

<dt id="text-editing-contenteditable">contentEditable</dt>
<dd>
In contrast to the designMode, the contentEditable attribute makes just some part of the document (like a  <code>div</code>-element) editable [http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#contenteditable]. Listing 3 shows how the attribute can be used:
</dd>
</dl>
<figure id="contentEditable-example" class="listing">
<pre>
<code>&lt;div contentEditable="true"&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>
</pre>
<figcaption>
Example contentEditable. Source: Author&#8217;s own work
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>-element down below is now editable due to setting the <code>&lt;contentEditable&gt;</code>-element equal to true (pleas visit <a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/requirements-and-design-for-a-tool-to-author-triple-statements/#text-editing">http://renatostauffer.ch/requirements-and-design-for-a-tool-to-author-triple-statements/#text-editing</a> if you read this thesis on paper).
</p>
<div class="test-editable" contentEditable="true">
You can edit this div element. Try it&#8230;
</div>

<p>

<p>
After determining different approaches, a Web research was made to see what kind of authoring on the Web (inline or framed) offers the best editing experience, with Linked Research&#8217;s established requirements in mind. Searches on <a href="http:google.com">Google.com</a> with the search terms <samp>in-place editing user experience wysiwyg</samp>, <samp>inline editing user experience wysiwyg</samp> and <samp>inplace editing user experience wysiwyg</samp> resulted in the following:
</p>
<p>
As far as it comes to editing experience for WYSIWYG editors, inline editing (also called in-place editing or inline edit) is emerging. This is shown by [http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/wysiwyg-round/] as they compiled blog posts from different sources and show the discussion around this approach.
</p>
<p>
Also, big Content Management Systems like Drupal picked up on this development. Their Drupal distribution Spark aimed to work out solutions for authoring experience problems. This included the implementation of an inline WYSIWYG editor [https://www.drupal.org/project/spark].
</p>
<p>
Other services like <a href="http://medium.com">Medium.com</a> claim to be the best writing tool on the Web by applying the inline editing strategy and stripping out a lot of formatting features other editors offer [https://medium.com/about/writing-in-medium-df8eac9f4a5e]. Jeff Eaton, senior digital strategist at Lullabot, sees potential for focused web sites like Medium.com by applying this strategy [https://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/inline-editing-and-cost-leaky-abstractions].
</p>
<p>
For Linked Research, the inline editing approach is a suitable option too, as its formatting is also very focused (see requirement XXX). This enables the author to concentrate on the actual content of his / her publication.
<p>
The challenge is to find an inline WYSIWYG editor that matches the established requirements from <a href="http://renatostauffer.ch/requirements-and-design-for-a-tool-to-author-triple-statements/#requirements-goals">section 5.3</a>. Especially the requirements Edit text (F-1), Text formatting (F-4), Enrich DOM (F-13), Add new Paragraph (F-16), Add new Section (F-17) and The DOM needs to keep it&#8217;s semantical representation (F-18) need to be considered when evaluating a possible editor.
</p>
The following categories including different criteria for the comparison were established:
<dl>
<dt>General information</dt>
<dd>This category includes general information about the editors.</dd>
<dt>Support</dt>
<dd>&#8220;Support&#8221; looks if there is a community around the editor and if there is documentation available. As stated by [https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/9767/store.pdf?sequence=2&#038;isAllowed=y], open source projects often lack good documentation. Thus this is an important attribute, when considering the editor.</dd>
<dt>Requirement Fulfillment</dt>
<dd>This category determines if the editor fulfills the established requirements from section 5</dd>
<dt>Extensibility</dt>
<dd>To make it possible for Linked Research to work, new functionality has to be added to the editor. This category looks if the editor can easily be extended with custom buttons and events attached to it.</dd>
<dt>Compatibility</dt>
<dd>This checks how well an editor handles different browser versions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Table 45 &#8211; 49 compare all possible editors for Linked Research with its corresponding criteria. Those editors were determined by doing search on <a href="https://www.google.ch/?gws_rd=ssl">Google.com</a> (used search terms: <samp>wysiwyg</samp> <samp>clean html</samp>, <samp>wysiwyg comparison</samp>, <samp>inline HTML editors</samp>, <samp>rich text editors comparison</samp>, <samp>rte comparison</samp>, <samp>medium.com clone</samp>) and <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a> (used search terms: <samp>inline browser editor</samp>, <samp>html editor browser</samp>, <samp>inline html editor</samp>, <samp>medium.com clone</samp>, <samp>medium.com</samp>, <samp>wysiwyg</samp>, <samp>wysiwyg inline editor</samp>).

Through the study of the existing Linked Research documentation, meetings with Sarven Capadisli and research on requirements for SCA tools, suitable functional and non-functional requirements were established. Important objects for the implementation have been discovered and a possible user interface for Linked Research&#8217;s triple editor has been proposed using mockups. Thus the goals to design the triple editor as well as to record functional and non-functional requirements have been reached.
</p>
<p>
Editors and RDFa parser libraries have been compared. Tables XXX from section XXX show the result of this comparison. The code examples on github serve as showcases for the different libraries and can be used as a starting point when implementing the components.

<p>
The requirements are now open to be transformed to the repository or the documentation of Linked Research. Additionally Sarven Capadisli can now evaluate a suitable editor and RDFa parser component based on the established tables in section XXX.
</p>
<p>
Although the focus concerning non-functional requirements lies on usability, accessibility and evolvability, Linked Research has not established requirements concerning other non-functional properties like efficiency or reliability yet. Those are open to be defined.
</p>
<p>
The proposed user interface for the triple editor is open to be implemented. Also an interface to view the document as a graph of RDF triples has not been designed yet. Based on the requirements, in suitable tooling and best practices can be investigated to find a proper solution.
